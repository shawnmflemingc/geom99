# Google Mapping Examples

*Note With API key restrictions now in place, code or examples no longer functioning are because you likely deviated from paths requested in checklist and therefore your code does not meet the wildcard restrictions placed on the given key.*
## All-star examples
### Sarah's Piping Plovers
This excellent integrated example tells a story, shows it on the map and is interactive. It uses street maps, MyMaps and photos to provide the reader a great experience.

### Dale's Prehistoric Landscape of Stonehenge
This example dives into an interesting story about the landscape elements around Stonehenge. It also uses well-documented code with excellent comments.

### Jame's St. Michael's Line
Another very interesting story that really shines with maps. It combines MyMaps and JavaScript API maps together to bring the viewer to each location.

### Lucy's Waterfalls in City of Hamilton
Dividing up the maps into separate items can help tell a story. Understanding where the waterfalls are, and how to get to them on different maps does help tell a story.

## GitHub Markdown Documentation Examples

Using MarkDown to communicate technical information is an industry standard and great alternative to webpages. Here are a few good examples from this lab.

## Other Notable JavaScript API Examples
There were many great examples. Some could not be shared here because the URL path given was not adheared to and now those maps do not function :-(
